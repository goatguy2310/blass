# blass
Basic Linear Algebra Subprogram Simplified

## To-do list

### Tensor
- [x] More comprehensive constructors (for `initializer_list` for example)
- [x] Getters
- [x] Add stride and offset (easier to handle when data structure changes)
- [x] Flatten, reshape, slicing, transpose
- [ ] Basic math ops
    - [x] Element-wise
    - [ ] Broadcasting
    - [ ] Matmul, convolution
- [ ] Threading
- [ ] Autograd

### Graph compiler (to optimize autograd graph)
- [ ] Graph
- [ ] Constant
- [ ] Whatever
